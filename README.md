## Cyanide
(copied from cyanide's README.md)

*cyanide seems to be something that will make me want to drink cyanide a lot less - Starmute, world generation datapack wizard.*

A mod which substantially improves Minecraft's data driven world generation error detection and recovery mechanisms. It removes unnecessary stack traces and generates user-friendly error messages for most common issues with world generation datapacks. For some examples of what improvements Cyanide makes to error reporting, see the below table:
